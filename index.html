<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
	<h3>Showcasing Strengths</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As I have developed the enhancements and ePortfolio throughout this course, one of the strengths I demonstrated was being able to provide visual presentations and thorough explanations, as found in my code review and narratives. Given that the code review can explain the problems found with previous programs, it would be useful for collaborating with teams because it serves as information for keeping them on board with what solutions are to be expected for programs. The code review also has visual highlights and indications of sections, which can also help with stakeholders who are more visual learners, and thus help them to comprehend the given information more. Even when the code is complete by the time the narratives are done, the narratives also provide vital information that would attract stakeholders. The information not only proves that the complete nature of the enhancements was successful, but also demonstrates various skills that would encourage the stakeholders to invest in coders for projects. All three of the projects individually show my strengths in dealing with software engineering, as demonstrated through understanding different languages in the enhancement for Project Two from CS410, also demonstrating how one programming language may be more suitable than another. As I have also dealt with data structures and algorithms, alongside databases, they are regarded in the enhancements for Project Two of CS300 and Project Three of CS360, respectively. Each of these projects deals with binary search and databases of users and events, respectively, showing that they are appropriate for these skills. As all projects also had prominent issues with potential user exploits, these two projects also demonstrate my abilities for how to meet proper security standards in programming.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; When I complete the ePortfolio, it showcases my strengths in understanding how to create an intuitive design, which is an important concept I have learned in UI and UX design. Additionally, creating the ePortfolio also reinforced my understanding of HTML, as I had previously done so in courses like Full Stack Development. Moreover, there also exist skills I have developed throughout the course, beyond the provided artifacts and the ePortfolio. For example, I had demonstrated my creativity and passion in projects, as found in Computational Graphics and Visualization, when I recreated the debut album cover from Weezer. Because of my enjoyment in creating such projects, it could also increase my employability status, as it can help teams push for creating programs that would ultimately encourage user interactivity with them. Another important strength I have learned is to think outside the box, even if the course was not quite related to computer science. In Discrete Mathematics, I learned that while LaTeX would be utilized to edit PDF files, I found that converting the PDF file to a DOC file to be more easily edited and exported as a PDF file would be a more sufficient solution. This can also attract employers because they would want to seek efficient and effective solutions when completing tasks, which is especially natural for wanting to keep programs as efficient to make tasks completed sooner rather than later.</p>
	<h3>Bringing Artifacts Together</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; All provided artifacts are appropriate throughout the portfolio, as they provide individual ways that I have created grade-A programs throughout courses and even found unique ways to make them better in features and security. These enhancements are meant to demonstrate how I would meet proper programming standards, alongside preventing exploits from happening within the programs. Additionally, when possible, I even demonstrated ways to have program users engage in the program, mainly through encouraging interest.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Two from CS410 demonstrates how some programming languages are appropriate for use than others. The code was originally converted from assembly to C++, with additional security features in the process. Even though I received a perfect grade on the assignment, I received feedback that practices like “using namespace std” are considered bad practice for reasons such as namespace pollution. So while I was using the features from Python to avoid this issue, I also used other features like its native rounding system to its advantage, and even took the opportunity to add division and modulo as functions for encouraging user interaction. Not only did I meet the standards of avoiding namespace pollution, but I also maintained a form of security in the program to avoid any divisions by zero and thereby premature program terminations.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Two from CS300 shows that even while the binary search tree is working perfectly, other seemingly minor features, like loading the CSV file, can lead to security and exploitation issues. Thus, creating features like treating a loaded file as a new one significantly helped solve the security issue, as the binary search can have a harder time finding an index, especially when attempting deletes of the final element. Just like the previous assignment, I also took the opportunity to add other interactive features that encourage user-friendliness, such as adding a feature to let the users take time to view prerequisites and requiring that searches or deletes need to load first.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Three from CS360 demonstrates that with databases, there should be updates to elements as necessary, as found in passwords from users. Whereas division and modulo, and messages would be ways to pique interest for users, a system to change passwords is perhaps the most necessary enhancement. Since some passwords may be cracked sooner than others, or even instantaneously, the program needed to have a security measure to allow users to change their passwords to avoid unwanted and unauthorized users from accessing accounts. Thus, the added button after logging in to change the password was added, which demonstrates my ability to understand how to update elements in any database and to understand how certain security standards would be necessary to establish a sustainable program.</p>

<h2>Enhancement One – Project Two from CS410</h2>
	<h3>Original Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/nlthxq">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Modified Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/vtvkgd">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Artifact Description</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Two from CS-410 is a program that allows users to input two numbers to print the complete equation for the sum, difference, or product of the two provided numbers. This project was created and completed by December 12, 2024.</p>
	<h3>Artifact Inclusion Justification</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; I selected Project Two from CS-410 because even though it got a perfect grade for the course, I still got feedback for its use of “using namespace std” at the start of C++. Programmers agree that utilizing this line is considered bad practice as it leads to <a href="https://dev.to/iamcymentho/using-namespace-std-in-c-why-its-considered-bad-practice-2adf#:~:text=This%20means%20you%20can%20use,specifying%20std::%20before%20them.&text=Namespace%20Pollution:%20When%20you%20bring,you%27ll%20have%20a%20problem">namespace pollution, readability problems, and maintenance challenges</a>. So, as I switched over the written code from C++ to Python, I not only demonstrated the skills of successfully transferring code to another language, but I also wanted to ensure that I would avoid the three given problems. It is because Python does not require the use of “std” in the first place, and that particular name and later code would be easier to keep track of.</p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; I would say that I completely and successfully met the course outcomes to write the C++ code of Project Two from CS-410, and to convert it to Python code using PyCharm! While attempting to draw parallels between C++ and Python, I noticed that Python has an easier way of getting rid of trailing zeros as opposed to C++, thereby resulting in me having to write fewer lines of code. In total, 127 lines were written in Python as opposed to 216 lines in C++, also showing that I understand what the most optimal language is to transfer a program like Project Two from CS-410 in. This ultimately meets with the outcomes of meeting industry standards, being that I demonstrated versatility within languages and keeping the efficiency of written code within the program. Finally, beyond what I planned for my outcomes, I also decided to utilize the opportunity of allowing inputs like “1.0” as choices to yield it as “1”, as I had not done so in C++. Moreover, I decided that this would be the opportunity to add division and modulo as options for the user, as I would argue that additional features would benefit a program to enhance its interactability with it. Most notably, there are more uses of appropriate functions as opposed to the original C++ program, where the only functions were removing trailing zeros and checking the validity of inputs as numbers. Thus, industry standards within programming can be user-friendliness with the acceptance of inputs like “1.0”, alongside encouraging user engagement with division and modulo as options.</p>
	<h3>Enhancement Reflections</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As I was improving the program, I found that “Ctrl + R” is a nifty feature that allows me to mass replace lines of code with different aspects. This meant that I could convert a line such as <span class="courier-new">cout << "- 1)Add -\n";</span> to <span class="courier-new">print("- 1)Add -")</span>, by simply entering "cout << " and replacing it with "print(". Of course, I would remove then remove "<<", then the escape newline sequence, and finally add the closing parentheses as necessary. Another aspect I learned as a reminder is that utilizing functions is a crucial aspect to prevent the code from repeating itself. The Python code I wrote was significantly shorter than the C++ code, since I was utilizing functions to show messages like proper number formatting for entering the first and second numbers. Some other lessons I learned is that I should write down and plan my tests, as an overall guide to make sure that I do not miss any missing aspect from the program, from minor aspects like making sure that "0" has no trailing zeros and negative signs to major aspects like ensuring that the program accepts valid inputs.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Some of the challenges I experienced were not only getting used to PyCharm, but also refreshing myself on how to utilize Python again, as I have been constantly shifting between languages and could not quite focus on a single one. Improving the formatting for the program, alongside its ability to be kept track of, were also some challenges while writing the program, as I wanted to make a conscious effort to make sure that the program does not end up appearing messy like the C++ program. Of course, I overcame this challenge by using functions and appropriate methods, and took advantage of aspects like Python having native trailing zero removal support over C++. Commenting on all the enhancements was also challenging for me, as I was also shifting focus to goals like ultimately converting the code and making sure that it works as intended. To overcome this, I decided that writing functions would be considered an enhancement for less clutter for the overall code, and even decided that utilizing division and modulo were enhancements because they were additional features in the program.</p>

<h2>Enhancement Two – Project Two from CS300</h2>
	<h3>Original Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/zzj5wl">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Modified Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/ty5391">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Artifact Description</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Two from CS-300 is a program that serves as a way for users to load a list of classes from a CSV file, then have the choice to display them all, display the prerequisites of a course by ID, or remove a listed course by ID.</p>
	<h3>Artifact Inclusion Justification</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; The reason for selecting Project Two from CS-300 is that this was one of the only applicable assignments that I could easily find from my GitHub, while being relevant to algorithms and data structures. Other than that, I also wanted to challenge myself to figure out how I can take a working program utilizing binary search, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complexity-analysis-of-binary-search/">an efficient method of searching</a>, and still find problems that existed within the project. The problem I found within the original version of Project Two was that, because courses can be reloaded many times, it creates duplicate courses by ID. So, when attempting to remove the final listed course in the list by ID after reloading with duplicates, the program prematurely terminates. Thus, a major improvement to prevent this issue was that I added a condition that checks if courses have already been loaded the first time. Once courses have already been loaded, the boolean condition for checking that will remain as true, meaning that new course loads will reset the course list by setting the course list to a new binary search object instead of keeping the same one. Similarly, using the boolean for checking whether courses have been loaded, I added the condition that would force the program to move on after 2.5 seconds if courses cannot be found as they were not loaded yet. But I also needed to make sure that the same would happen if all courses were removed. To do this, I needed to make sure that the integer size from the binary search tree object would be decremented when there is a successful removal. That way, I can directly get the size and check if it is 0, and then display the message as it should.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Another improvement I made was to address an error that pops up when no courses are listed, which is especially useful if courses have not been loaded yet or if all courses by ID have been removed. I also improved the program by having courses with no prerequisites properly listed as “none”, as the previous version did not properly format it as intended. One other improvement I also felt was necessary was to change the sleep time from 5 seconds to 2.5 seconds, as I wanted the program to still be efficient in functionality, yet prevent users from entering too many inputs at once. The third listed improvement would be that I decided that the message for entering a key should be any key instead of whitespace, as entering any other given key other than “y” would allow the program to still move forward anyway. Related to entering any key to continue, I felt that after the prerequisites for a found course were displayed, the program would allow the user to enter any key instead of having it automatically moving forward after a given amount of time. This is especially necessary as 2.5 seconds may be too fast for some users to comprehend the information provided.</p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Yes, I successfully met the course outcome of utilizing a proper security practice of overloading information on duplicate courses, as I would have a course list set to a new binary search tree instead of keeping the same one. Albeit this was not mentioned in the Module One assignment, I discovered and mentioned in my code review that reloading courses to allow duplicates also causes issues when removing the last listed course in a provided list when copied, as it causes the program to prematurely crash. Therefore, I fixed a significant security issue of programs prematurely crashing, as they should still remain functioning until they gracefully terminate.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As the course outcome of preventing duplicate courses also meets consistency and user-friendliness, I was also pushing for these aspects in areas such as checking course emptiness when displaying courses, changing the message from entering “y” to any key for proceeding, and leaving the displayed prerequisites up for as long as the user desires to. Therefore, when it comes to updates for my outcome-coverage plans, I feel that these new aspects are essentially updates for how I enhanced the program via consistency and user-friendliness, which goes beyond the intended outcomes for maintaining security in the program.</p>
	<h3>Enhancement Reflections</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; When enhancing and modifying the artifact, I learned that while functions may be necessary for repeating code with a larger number of lines, it may not be necessary if it is only three lines of code being repeated, especially for code that appears shorter and is only being repeated two times. I had a slight challenge thinking about whether or not I should make these as functions, but I also had a warning as a result of using “cin >> key” within a void function, also deterring me from utilizing the three repeated lines as a working function.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Besides that, I also learned that programs should be user-intuitive, and even understood the program from a user perspective by allowing users to enter any key when they want to move on after getting the displayed prerequisites based on the course they input. This was not as challenging, as it was an easy solution using an if-else statement, with the “if” condition allowing for entering new keys while the “else” statement makes the program move on as it should.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As I also want to seek consistency, with enhancement three allowing for changing passwords, I also wanted to seek consistency for the program to not allow for displaying courses if there are none to exist. While I easily followed the same formula by using the “loaded” boolean variable, I also found it challenging to trace back to how I could effectively change the size after removing a course. At that point, I learned that writing comments is essentially crucial for programs, as it allows people to trace back where certain parts work as they should.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Although creating a system where courses should not allow duplicates was relatively easy, the real challenge came with trying to figure out where I would find real flaws within the program to thereby give effective enhancements. I initially thought that because the binary search tree already works well, it would not be necessary for me to fix the program whatsoever. However, after tinkering with he program, I discovered that loading the courses brings the security issue of allowing duplicates, and thereby a higher difficulty for the binary search to work as it should. Thus, I learned that while it is important for a program to work as it should, one should try to actively look for any flaws within the program, so that they can be improved sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Enhancement Three  – Project Three from CS360</h2>
	<h3>Original Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/3di2mm">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Modified Artifact</h3>
		 <p><a href="https://rb.gy/86roc3">ZIP File</a></p> 
	<h3>Artifact Description</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Project Three from CS-360 is an Android app meant to allow logged-in users to create a list of events as reminders for when to initiate them. When users create events, they can add, update, or delete events, and have all events displayed on a list.</p>
	<h3>Artifact Inclusion Justification</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Not only is Project Three an example of dealing with databases, but this may perhaps be the most difficult assignment I have written code for. This project shows my skills in understanding how to create a working graphical user interface, alongside my first significant time in how to create a working Android app with a specific goal in mind. Due to the complex methods and functions involving logging in, alongside dealing with creating, reading, updating, and deleting events from a database, it also meant that I needed to make sure that every written component for the activities and XML files function as they should. As I have also utilized and cited references from YouTube and my professor, it not only demonstrates my ability to create a login system and a working database of events, but also shows my skills of utilizing various resources to ultimately learn more information like this. As for improving the artifact, I added a button within the events database that allows users to update their passwords. After a user enters a new password while retyping it to confirm it, the user will be able to update their password, and thus return to the events database. When a user logs in again, their password would already have been updated, showing that the enhancement works as it should. Given that <a href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/">passwords may be cracked faster than others</a>, adding the update password button by itself effectively improves the artifact.</p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As the course outcome is to develop a security mindset to enhance security, I essentially met this outcome from Module One by focusing on developing a way for users to update their passwords, with <a href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/">passwords ranging in vulnerability</a>. However, other than the main update based on Module One, I do not have any other significant updates to my outcome-coverage plans, other than that the program somehow switched from a blue theme to a purple theme. Nonetheless, if I were to advance my program further beyond my original plans, I would also make sure that events are shown unique to the user, and even find a way to update the timer to function when events are added.</p>
	<h3>Enhancement Reflections</h3>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; As I was learning to create the enhancements, I learned that there should be a consistent style between the databases of users and events. Whereas the user database utilizes returning booleans for inserting and deleting events, the event database utilizes void methods with toast messages to confirm changes. Nonetheless, I also learned that despite the different styles of programming, searching for parallels between how certain databases handle inserts and updates can also be important for what a programmer may do depending on the given situations. For me, I felt that changing the top text would be a consistent style for inserts and updates for users, whereas I felt that toast messages worked better for events.</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; The first challenge I faced when attempting to update the program was that the emulator would not run, since I had too much storage on my C drive. Thus, I simply got over that challenge by moving unneeded files for that drive to another drive. However, the main challenge I experienced was due to the high number of activities and XML files, alongside the fact that the code was long; it took me some relearning on how the code I wrote worked. With the given tests for updating passwords for users, it took me some trial and error to figure out how I could fix the problem, meaning I would have to analyze how the code I wrote worked before and try to replicate those workings when adding the new feature of updating passwords.</p>
